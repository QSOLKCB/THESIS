  "description": "This repository contains the LaTeX source, figures, datasets and scripts for the E8 Fractal Cosmology Model by Trent Slade (QSOL IMC). The model introduces a unified cosmological framework featuring an E8-symmetric scalar field (“Magnetium”) with golden-ratio (φ ≈ 1.618) fractal scaling, which drives galactic and cosmological observables including dark matter, dark energy, rotation curves, gravitational waves, supermassive black hole scaling, quantum information analogies and archaeoacoustic resonance phenomena.",
